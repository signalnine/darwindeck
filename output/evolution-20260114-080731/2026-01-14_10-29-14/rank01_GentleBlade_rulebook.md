# GentleBlade

## Overview
GentleBlade is a strategic 2-player card game where you'll discard unwanted cards, then engage in three rounds of tactical play to either capture all your opponent's cards, empty your hand first, or achieve the highest score. With multiple paths to victory, every decision matters as you balance aggressive capture tactics with efficient hand management.

## Components
- Standard 52-card deck (2 players)
- Chips or tokens (5252 per player)
- Score tracking (pen and paper)

## Setup
1. Shuffle the deck
2. Deal 24 cards to each player
3. Place 1 card face-up to start the discard pile
4. Give each player 5252 chips
5. Place remaining cards face-down as the draw pile

## Objective
Win by either:
- Capture all cards to win
- First player to empty their hand wins
- Player with the highest score wins

## Turn Structure
Each turn consists of 4 phase(s):

### Phase 1: Discard
Discard 1 card

### Phase 2: Play
Play exactly 1 card to the tableau

### Phase 3: Play
Play exactly 1 card to the tableau

### Phase 4: Play
Play exactly 1 card to the tableau

## Edge Cases
**Empty deck:** Shuffle the discard pile (except top card) to form a new deck. If still empty, skip the draw.

**No valid plays:** Draw up to 3 cards until you can play, then pass if still unable.

**Tie:** If multiple players meet win conditions simultaneously, the active player wins.

**Turn limit:** If max turns reached, highest score wins (or draw if no scoring).
