# GrandWall

## Overview
GrandWall is a strategic two-player card game where players engage in two rounds of betting before attempting to capture all their opponent's cards through tactical play. Victory goes to the player who can successfully claim every card on the table through skillful wagering and calculated moves.

## Components
- Standard 52-card deck (2 players)
- Chips or tokens (487 per player)

## Setup
1. Shuffle the deck
2. Deal 26 cards to each player
3. Give each player 487 chips
4. Place remaining cards face-down as the draw pile

## Objective
Capture all cards to win

## Turn Structure
Each turn consists of 4 phase(s):

### Phase 1: Betting
Betting round (minimum bet: 10 chips, max 2 raises)

### Phase 2: Betting
Betting round (minimum bet: 20 chips, max 3 raises)

### Phase 3: Play
Play exactly 1 card to the tableau

### Phase 4: Play
Play exactly 1 card to the tableau

## Edge Cases
**Empty deck:** Shuffle the discard pile (except top card) to form a new deck. If still empty, skip the draw.

**No valid plays:** Draw up to 3 cards until you can play, then pass if still unable.

**Tie:** If multiple players meet win conditions simultaneously, the active player wins.

**All-in:** If you can't afford to call, you may go all-in with remaining chips.

**Pot split:** If the pot can't split evenly, odd chips go to the player left of dealer.

**Turn limit:** If max turns reached, highest score wins (or draw if no scoring).
